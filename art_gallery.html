    <h1> Creation of The Century</h1>
    <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
    <p>The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci is a half-body portrait of a woman, widely thought to be Lisa del Giocondo, seated before an imaginary landscape and known for its enigmatic smile and sfumato technique. The painting breaks with traditional Italian portraiture by showing the subject in a three-quarter view with folded arms, a departure from the profile pose. The soft, blended brushwork creates a subtle, ambiguous expression, particularly around the eyes and mouth, which seems to shift depending on where the viewer focuses. </p>
